Description: A package for the openVA shiny app for analyzing verbal autopsy (VA) data.
  The data should come from the WHO 2016 VA questionnaire.  Currently, the InterVA5 and
  InSilicoVA algorithms can be used to assign causes of death by age group and sex.
  The app displays a summary and plot of the Cause-Specific Mortality Fractions (for each
  group); and the results are available for download.
